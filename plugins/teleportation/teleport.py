Quantum Teleportation Simulation Module

This module simulates the quantum teleportation protocol.
Alice has an unknown qubit state and shares an entangled pair with Bob.
She performs a Bell measurement on her unknown qubit and her half of the entangled pair,
then sends the classical bits to Bob, who applies corrections.
After corrections, Bob's qubit is measured to collapse it into a classical basis state.
