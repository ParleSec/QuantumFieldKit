      <h4>Grover's Algorithm: Quantum Search</h4>
      <p>Grover's algorithm, developed by Lov Grover in 1996, is a quantum algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup for searching unsorted databases or solving unstructured search problems.</p>
      
      <div class="alert alert-secondary">
        <strong>Classical vs. Quantum Search</strong>: To find a specific item in an unsorted database of N items, a classical computer needs to check an average of N/2 items (O(N) complexity). Grover's algorithm can find the item in approximately √N steps (O(√N) complexity).

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Initialization</strong>: Start with all qubits in superposition, representing all possible states with equal probability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Oracle Application</strong>: Apply a special function (oracle) that marks the target state by flipping its phase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Amplitude Amplification</strong>: Apply the Grover diffusion operator, which increases the amplitude of the marked state while decreasing others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Iteration</strong>: Repeat steps 2-3 approximately √N times to maximize the probability of measuring the target state.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Measurement</strong>: Measure the qubits to obtain the target state with high probability.
        </li>

        <p>Imagine looking for a specific person wearing a red shirt in a large crowd where everyone else wears blue shirts. In the classical approach, you'd have to inspect people one by one until you find the person in red.</p>
        <p>Grover's algorithm is like having a special camera that slightly brightens the image of the person in red and slightly dims everyone else each time you take a photo. After taking several photos (around √N photos for N people), the person in red becomes so bright compared to others that they're immediately obvious.</p>
        <p>The "quantum magic" happens because all people are examined simultaneously in superposition, and the algorithm amplifies the probability of finding the right person through constructive and destructive interference of quantum amplitudes.</p>
