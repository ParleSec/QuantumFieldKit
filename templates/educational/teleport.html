      <h4>Quantum Teleportation Protocol</h4>
      <p>Quantum teleportation is a process by which the exact state of a quantum system can be transmitted from one location to another, with the help of classical communication and previously shared quantum entanglement between the sending and receiving locations.</p>
      
      <div class="alert alert-secondary">
        <strong>Classical vs. Quantum</strong>: Unlike classical data transfer where information is copied bit by bit, quantum teleportation transfers the entire quantum state without violating the no-cloning theorem. The original state is destroyed in the process, preserving quantum mechanics principles.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Entanglement Distribution</strong>: Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of qubits (a Bell pair).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>State Preparation</strong>: Alice has a third qubit in an unknown quantum state that she wants to teleport to Bob.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bell Measurement</strong>: Alice performs a joint measurement on her unknown qubit and her half of the entangled pair.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Classical Communication</strong>: Alice sends the results of her measurement to Bob through a classical channel.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Quantum Correction</strong>: Based on Alice's measurement results, Bob applies appropriate quantum gates to his half of the entangled pair.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recovered State</strong>: Bob's qubit is now in the same quantum state that Alice's original qubit was in.

      <h5>Real-World Applications</h5>
      <p>While quantum teleportation doesn't transport matter or energy, it has significant applications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quantum Networks</strong>: Creating secure, long-distance quantum communication channels.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantum Computing</strong>: Moving quantum information between different parts of a quantum computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantum Repeaters</strong>: Extending the range of quantum communication by breaking it into manageable segments.</li>
        <li><strong>Distributed Quantum Computing</strong>: Linking separate quantum processors together to form larger systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Limitations and Challenges</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resource Requirements</strong>: Requires pre-distributed entanglement, which is difficult to maintain.</li>
        <li><strong>Classical Channel Dependence</strong>: Still requires classical information transfer, limiting speed to c (speed of light).</li>
        <li><strong>Fidelity Loss</strong>: Environmental noise can degrade the quality of teleported states.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability Issues</strong>: Teleporting multiple qubits requires exponentially more resources.</li>

        <p>Imagine Alice and Bob each have one half of a pair of magical coins. These coins always show opposite faces when observed (heads/tails). Alice also has a third special coin with a unique pattern she wants to send to Bob.</p>
        <p>Alice cannot examine her special coin without changing it, nor can she describe it to Bob perfectly. Instead, she puts her special coin and her half of the entangled pair into a "magical box" that tells her whether the coins are showing the same or different faces, but doesn't reveal what those faces are.</p>
        <p>Alice then calls Bob and tells him the result. Based on this information, Bob performs specific flips on his coin. Remarkably, Bob's coin now has exactly the same pattern that was on Alice's special coin, which has lost its pattern in the process.</p>

<h5>Quantum Teleportation</h5>
<p>Quantum teleportation is a protocol that transfers the exact quantum state from one location to another using shared entanglement and classical communication.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">
  <strong>Key Quantum Concept:</strong> The protocol allows quantum information to be transmitted without violating the <em>no-cloning theorem</em>, as the original state is destroyed during the process.
