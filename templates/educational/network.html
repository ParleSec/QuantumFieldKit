      <h4>Entanglement Swapping Protocol</h4>
      <p>Entanglement swapping is a quantum protocol that allows two particles to become entangled even though they have never interacted with each other, by performing specific measurements on intermediary particles that were previously entangled with them.</p>
      
      <div class="alert alert-secondary">
        <strong>Classical vs. Quantum</strong>: In classical physics, correlations between objects require either direct interaction or a common cause. Entanglement swapping creates quantum correlations between previously unrelated particles, with no classical analog, enabling quantum networks without direct interactions between end nodes.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Initial Entanglement</strong>: Create two separate Bell pairs: particles A and B are entangled, and particles C and D are entangled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Intermediate Node Setup</strong>: Particles B and C are brought together at an intermediate node.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bell Measurement</strong>: Perform a joint Bell-state measurement on particles B and C.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Measurement Result Communication</strong>: The result of this measurement is communicated classically to the holders of particles A and D.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conditional Operation</strong>: Based on the measurement outcome, appropriate quantum operations are applied to particles A and/or D.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Entanglement Creation</strong>: Particles A and D are now entangled, despite never having interacted directly.

      <p>Entanglement swapping enables several important quantum technologies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quantum Repeaters</strong>: Extending the range of quantum communication beyond direct transmission limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantum Networks</strong>: Creating entanglement between distant nodes without direct quantum channels.</li>
        <li><strong>Measurement-Based Quantum Computing</strong>: Facilitating interactions between qubits in cluster states.</li>
        <li><strong>Distributed Quantum Computing</strong>: Connecting separate quantum processors into a larger quantum system.</li>

      <h5>Limitations and Challenges</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bell Measurement Difficulty</strong>: Complete Bell-state measurements are challenging with linear optics.</li>
        <li><strong>Fidelity Loss</strong>: Each swapping operation introduces some loss of entanglement quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Timing Synchronization</strong>: Requires precise coordination between measurement and correction operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Decoherence</strong>: Entanglement is highly sensitive to noise and environmental interaction.</li>

      <div class="card-header">Beginner's Analogy: Understanding Entanglement Swapping</div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Imagine four friends: Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave. Initially, Alice and Bob share a pair of special dice that always sum to 7 when rolled. Similarly, Charlie and Dave share another pair of these special dice.</p>
        <p>Bob and Charlie meet and roll their dice together. They then call Alice and Dave to tell them what they got. Based on this information, Alice and Dave apply specific rules to their own dice.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, after this process, Alice and Dave's dice are now magically connected (always summing to 7) even though they never met, while Bob and Charlie's dice lose their special properties. The "dice magic" has been swapped from the original pairs to connect Alice and Dave directly.</p>
